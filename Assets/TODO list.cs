public class TODOlist : MonoBehaviour
{
   /* GameManager
    * 
    * if the level is done set PlayerManager.canMove = false and animal.canmove = false
    * play some sort of cinematic
    * start a new level
    * 

    * Animals
    * 
    * tweak stats so some move longer but less often and stuff like that
    * 

    * Player
    * 
    * arms up (holding) sprites
    * maybe a whole different character
    * 

    * BoatAnimalCounter
    * 
    * list of all animals in boat DONE
    * add and remove on the trigger collider DONE
    * update to GameManager when all animals on boat DONE
    * update some sort of UI to show how many animals you have and how many are left on the island
    * 
    *
    
    * Ocean script
    * 
    * make the water animated
    * make a wave or some sort of flood but the boat area must be submerged last so i think a slow wave is better
    * or possibly multiple waves that cover like a part that becomes submerged
    * 
    * make warnings for where the wave is coming from and how wide
    

    * Tilemap
    * 
    * set colliders on wall type tiles
    * set out decorative tiles
    * make the map more interesting


    * BUGS
    * 
    * can throw through walls
    * Sometimes animals start to move when holding, they stop when player is moving though
    *
