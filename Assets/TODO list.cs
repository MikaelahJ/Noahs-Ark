{
    /* Menu stuff     
    * 
    * Get player stuff to see if continue is disabled or not
    * use that to start the correct level on continue
    * start level 1 on new game
    * settings where you can change music, sfx, fullscreen, 
    * fun animated credits menu
    * 
    * 
    * 
    * 
 
    * GameManager
    * 
    * if the level is done set PlayerManager.canMove = false and animal.canmove = false
    * play some sort of cinematic
    * start a new level - logic pretty much done
    * 

    * Animals
    * 
    * tweak stats so some move longer but less often and stuff like that
    * wiggle animation when holding
    * 

    * Player
    * 
    * arms up (holding) sprites
    * maybe a whole different character
    * 

    * BoatAnimalCounter - DONE
    * 
    * list of all animals in boat - DONE
    * add and remove on the trigger collider - DONE
    * update to GameManager when all animals on boat - DONE
    * update some sort of UI to show how many animals you have and how many are left on the island - DONE
    * 
    *
    
    * Ocean script
    * 
    * make the water animated
    * waves hitting the cliffs animations
    * make a wave or some sort of flood but the boat area must be submerged last so i think a slow wave is better
    * or possibly multiple waves that cover like a part that becomes submerged
    * 
    * make warnings for where the wave is coming from and how wide
    

    * Tilemap
    * 
    * set colliders on wall type tiles
    * set out decorative tiles
    * make the map more interesting
    * 


    * BUGS
    * 
    * can throw through walls
    * Sometimes animals start to move when holding, they stop when player is moving though
    * Pickup text not always working
